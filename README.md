## Concert Management System

**Welcome to the Concert Management System!**

This project implements a system to manage data about bands, venues, and concerts. It utilizes a relational database with raw SQL queries and Python functions for interaction.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Python 3 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
    - sqlite3 (included with Python) or psycopg2 (optional, install with `pip install psycopg2`)

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    - If you haven't already, clone your GitHub repository named `Concerts` locally:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Marvin-operator/Concerts.git
        ```

3. **Set Up the Database:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
    - Run the script (e.g., `create_tables.py`) that creates the necessary database tables (`bands`, `venues`, and `concerts`) with their respective columns.
    - Consider creating a script to populate the database with sample data for testing purposes.

4. **Run the Application:**
    - Identify the Python script serving as the main entry point (e.g., `main.py`).
    - Execute the script using the `python` command:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

**Functionality:**

The system offers several functions to manage concerts, bands, and venues:

- **Object Relationship Methods:**
    - Retrieve a concert's associated Band and Venue information.
    - List all concerts for a specific Venue or by a specific Band.
- **Aggregate and Relationship Methods:**
    - Check if a concert takes place in the band's hometown.
    - Generate an introduction string for a concert.
    - Create a new concert for a band at a particular venue and date.
    - Find the band with the most concerts overall and the most frequent band at a specific venue.

**Additional Notes:**

- Refer to the provided code comments and docstrings for specific function usage.
- Consider implementing error handling and input validation for robustness.

**Contribution:**

Feel free to extend the functionality by adding new methods or features!  Always document your changes clearly.
